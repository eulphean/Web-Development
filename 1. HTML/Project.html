    <h2><strong><u>Aroma Science</strong></u></h2>

    <p>While we explore how the sense of smell affects human brain, be patient with me as I take you through a list of scientific terms that will remind you of high school Biology. Following is an index of terminology:

            <li><strong><em>Olfaction:</strong></em> Sense of smell.</li><br />
            <li><strong><em>Olfactory Bulb:</strong></em> A neural structure right behind the human eyes, which is involved in Olfaction.</li><br />
            <li><strong><em>Thalamus:</strong></em> A neural structure that acts like a switchboard of information. Every sensory system (with the exception of the olfactory system) sends information to their respective thalamus nuclei in this structure, which then forwards the sensory signals to the associated regions in brain.</li><br />
            <li><strong><em>Amygdala:</strong></em> A neural structure that is responsible for the formation and storage of memories associated with emotional events. For example, during a fear condition, the sensory stimuli reach the amygdala, where they form associations with memories of the stimuli.</li><br />
            <li><strong><em>Hippocampus:</strong></em> This neural structure is significant in converting the content “in your brain” right now (short-term memory) into content preserved for the long run (long-term memory). A brain with a damaged hippocampus is unable to create new memories while older memories from the time before the damage stay intact. This phenomenon is accurately portrayed in movies like Memento and 50 First Dates.</li><br />
            <li><strong><em>Hypothalamus:</strong></em> This section of the brain is responsible for production of hormones. These hormones are solely responsible for maintaining body temperature, hunger, sleep, circadian rhythm, moods, sex drive, and release of other hormones in the body. The area of the brain is also responsible for behavior, autonomic, and endocrine functions in the body.</li><br />
            <img border=2 src="images\olfaction.png" style="float:right;height:250px;margin:20px 0px 0px 5px" />
            <li><strong><em>Pituitary Gland:</strong></em> Hypothalamus is “neurally” and “chemically” connected to this master gland, which also secretes hormones that is primarily responsible for growth, blood pressure, sex organ functions in both males and females, thyroid gland function, metabolism, pain relief, sleeping patterns, etc.</li><br />
            <li><strong><em>Limbic System:</strong></em> Limbic systems comprises of Amygdala, Hippocampus, and Hypothalamus. Overall, it’s responsible for adrenaline control, growth, metabolism, sexual pleasure, memory, etc.</li><br />    
        </ol>

        <p align="left">We, as humans consist of five senses. Vision, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Stimuli through these senses reach the human brain, which interprets these signals and associates them with the respective physical or chemical reactions. All four senses with the exception of smell takes about 5-7 synapses (an exchange of information between neurons in brain and spinal cord) to reach the thalamus to get interpreted. 
        However, the sense of smell is unique because it goes through at most two synapses to reach the limbic system of the brain. The first synapse is between the olfactory neurons in the nose and the olfactory bulb. The second synapse is between the olfactory bulb and the limbic system. The neurons that are stimulated from the olfactory bulb transmit signals to amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus neural structures. Research has proven that the sense of smell is 10,000 times more sensitive than other senses and the olfactory response is almost immediate. Therefore, within fraction of milliseconds, an aroma can alter the state of your limbic system of brain, making olfaction the single most powerful sense in the human body.

        <p>Science proves it that scents have a deep impression on our brains. Though every scent caters to a unique effect on one’s brain; however, here are the scents for the masses and their effects.</p>
